<h1>Amanuel Abiy's Coding Portfolio</h1>

<p>Welcome to my coding portfolio. This web application was built using React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for Animations.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>My coding portfolio was built to serve as a showcase of my skills, projects, and expertise in software development. As I continue to grow in my career, I plan to update the portfolio with new skills, projects, and experience.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Dynamic Animations</li>
  <li>Responsive Design</li>
  <li>Deployed on Vercel</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technologies-used">Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>React JS</code>: JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where the UI needs to update dynamically</li>
  <li><code>Tailwind CSS</code>: Utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to build custom designs quickly by using predefined classes directly in their HTML.</li>
  <li><code>Framer Motion</code>: React library for creating smooth, high-performance animations</li>
  <li><code>Vercel</code>: Cloud platform that provides an easy and efficient way to deploy, host, and scale web applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h2>
<p>The project follows a simple but effective structure that is common for React applications.</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>src/assets</code>: Contains the project's images. The images are organized into different categories such as projects and programming languages.</li>
    <li><code>src/components</code>: Contains React components. React components are the building blocks of a React application. They allow you to break down the user interface (UI) into reusable, independent pieces that manage their own state and logic.</li>
    <li><code>src/Cube</code>: This directory contains the React component for the animated cube along with a dedicated CSS file for its styling. I chose to place the cube in a separate folder to leverage standard CSS for its animation. The complexity of the animation made traditional CSS a more suitable choice, allowing for better code organization and maintainability.</li>
    <li><code>src/text</code>: Contains the text that I will use throughout the project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/amanuelabiy/Personal-Portfolio-Website</code></li>
  <li>Install dependencies: <code>npm install</code></li>
  <li>Run the application: <code>npm run dev</code></li>
</ol>
